- The AI must not create, edit, or modify any files or code without explicit user approval.
- Before performing any action, the AI should **summarize its intended changes or decision** to the user.
- The AI should then **ask the user for confirmation** (for example, "Shall I apply these changes?") and **wait for a clear yes** before proceeding.
- If the user does not explicitly approve the action, the AI must refrain from executing it.
- The AI should ask clarifying questions if uncertain, rather than guessing and acting.
